# School Directory â€” Next.js + Supabase (Starter)

This is a ready-to-run starter project for the School Directory mini-assignment.

## Features
- Add School page (form + image upload)
- Show Schools page (grid of school cards)
- Supabase used for Postgres + Storage (image bucket `schoolImages`)
- Tailwind CSS for responsive UI

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a Supabase project and in SQL run the table creation (see below).
3. Create a public storage bucket named `schoolImages`.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill values.
5. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Supabase SQL (run in SQL Editor)
```sql
create table if not exists public.schools (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  address text not null,
  city text not null,
  state text not null,
  contact text not null,
  image text not null,
  email_id text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

alter table public.schools enable row level security;

create policy "Public can read schools"
  on public.schools for select
  to public
  using (true);

create policy "Service role can insert"
  on public.schools for insert
  to service_role
  with check (true);
```

## Notes
- The server API uses the SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE key (only on server). Do **not** expose it in the browser.
- Make sure the `schoolImages` bucket is public (or you'll need signed URLs).
